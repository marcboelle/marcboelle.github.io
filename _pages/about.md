I am currently in my fourth and last year at École Polytechnique, enrolled in the MVA master's program at ENS Paris-Saclay. I have a strong background in applied mathematics and am interested in the theory and many applications of Machine and Deep Learning.

In 2024, I was a research affiliate at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, working on long-duration energy storage (LDES). I helped formulating the problem of determining the boundary cost of LDES in the US energy grid. Before that, in 2023, I was an intern at the Swiss research center CSEM, in the Digital Energy Solutions team. I worked on predicting photovoltaic production over a 24-hour horizon, necessary to regulate the load of the power grid. I designed Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks to extract cloud information from satellite images, on top of the Graphical Model used by the team.

In addition to this, I'm passionate about music (I studied piano for 12 years at the conservatory). I like to reinterpret what I hear and occasionally compose. I like playing badminton and tennis, running and hiking in beautiful places.
